# Ruby on Rails stack with Webpack, React, PG Database

### BOILERPLATE

**Notes:**

* Remember, if building this on a new VM make sure you have 
  * RVM
  * Nodejs AND NPM
  * Yarn installed (INSTALL THIS WAY: `npm install --global yarn`

This approach to React is via zayne.io "Build a React App with Ruby on Rails" - July 7th, 2018.

Had some trouble with other approaches to new ways of utilizing RoR, but this is the first one I got off the ground.  This is mostly because I kept installing webpacker dependencies incorrectly, primarily `Yarn`, which I first tried to install as a gem, and later tried to install with `sudo apt-get install`.

**TESTS**

* Works on Heroku

**Next steps:**

- test with new linux partition on VBox
